# mealtime-ext

Meal Time is a Chrome Extension timer that was made for people who forget to eat during the day.
The extension, takes in a users time input, and sends them a reminder/notification once that time interval has expired.

To set it up, the extension is loaded from the local computer to the Chrome
Extension home-page where it is packaged and made ready for uploading.

Once the packaging is done, the icon for the Meal Time extension appears on the Chrome browser toolbar.

To use the extension, the user will need to scroll to the options page using the button on the top.

Once the user is on the options page, they can choose their time interval, navigate back to the homepage
and click on the 'Start Timer' button. This activates the countdown, and the user will be able to see in real time
the amount of time left on the timer.

Once the set time interval is reached, the user will get an in browser notification that lets them know that it is time
to eat, and they should go ahead and grab some food.

The user can then choose to reset the timer, or they can check the auto-start box, so that the timer restarts automatically
once it has finished counting down and has sent out the notification.
